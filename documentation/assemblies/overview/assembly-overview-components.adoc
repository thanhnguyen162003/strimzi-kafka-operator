= Strimzi operators

[role="_abstract"]
Operators are Kubernetes components that package, deploy, and manage applications by extending the Kubernetes API. 
They simplify administrative tasks and reduce manual intervention.

Strimzi operators automate the deployment and management of Apache Kafka components on Kubernetes. 
Strimzi custom resources define the deployment configuration.

The following operators manage Kafka in a Kubernetes cluster:

Cluster Operator:: Manages Kafka clusters and related components.
Entity Operator:: Comprises the Topic Operator and User Operator.
Topic Operator:: Creates, configures, and deletes Kafka topics.
User Operator:: Manages Kafka users and their authentication credentials.

Additionally, Strimzi provides Drain Cleaner, a separate tool that can be used alongside the Cluster Operator to assist with safe pod eviction during maintenance or upgrades.
